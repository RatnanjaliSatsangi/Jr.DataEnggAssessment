#### Q3. Describe what these Git commands do to the commit history:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~5
git merge --squash HEAD@{1}
```
- [ ] They reset the HEAD to the fifth commit in the repo, then merge to the master branch.
- [ ] The current branch's HEAD is reset back five commits, then prior commits are squashed
into a single commit.
- [ ] They delete the last five commits.
- [ ] They merge the last five commits into a new branch.
 ANS: b.The current branch's HEAD is reset back five commits, then prior commits are squashed
into a single commit.

Explanation:
- `git reset --hard HEAD~5` resets the current branch to the commit just before the last 5 (see
`man gitrevisions` for details about this notation and other cool alternatives like `HEAD@{2 days
ago}`). As it is a hard reset, it will also overwrite every change in the working tree as well. See
`man git-reset`.
- `git merge --squash HEAD@{1}` HEAD@{1} is where the branch was just before the previous
command (again, see `man gitrevisions`). This command sets the state of the index to be as it
would just after a merge from that commit. This whole operation could be a way to take 5
commits from a branch in which you started a new feature and squash them to a single
commit, a meaningful one.
